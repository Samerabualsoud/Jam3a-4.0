# Jam3a-4.0 Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the Jam3a-4.0 application on Digital Ocean. The repository has been specifically configured to address previous deployment issues, particularly the missing '@radix-ui/react-separator' dependency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Fixes
- Added '@radix-ui/react-separator' to root package.json
- Added prebuild script to ensure dependency installation
- Multiple explicit installation points in the build process

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- Updated Dockerfile with multi-stage build process
- Modified digitalocean.app.yaml with explicit dependency installation
- Enhanced build command to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Optimized production deployment with Nginx

### 3. Build Process
- Added pre-build script to verify dependencies
- Ensured proper installation sequence for all packages
- Configured proper build output for production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy with Digital Ocean App Platform

1. Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Navigate to the App Platform section
3. Click "Create App"
4. Connect to your GitHub repository (Jam3a-4.0)
5. Select the main branch
6. In the settings:
   - Ensure the build command matches the one in digitalocean.app.yaml
   - Verify the Dockerfile path is correct
   - Configure all necessary environment variables
7. Complete the setup and deploy

### Option 2: Deploy with Dockerfile

If you prefer to deploy using the Dockerfile directly:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t jam3a-4 .`
3. Run the container: `docker run -p 80:80 jam3a-4`

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are configured:
- NODE_ENV: "production"
- (Add any other environment variables your application requires)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any deployment issues:

1. Verify that the build command includes installing '@radix-ui/react-separator'
2. Check the deployment logs for any missing dependencies
3. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
4. Verify that the Dockerfile is being used for the build process

## Maintenance

When updating the application:

1. Always ensure new dependencies are properly added to both package.json files
2. Test locally before deploying to production
3. Monitor build logs to catch any dependency issues early
